# R Challenge Series — Even Richardson

This repository contains five symbolic R programming challenges completed as part of my data science training. Each challenge goes beyond code—blending technical skill with meaning drawn from personal milestones, especially during my transition into fatherhood and deeper self-discipline.

## Challenges

### Challenge 6: Twin Growth Explorer  
Files:  
`challenge6_twin_growth.R`  
`challenge6_growth_plot.png`, `challenge6_vs_realworld_plot.png`  

Visualizes symbolic twin growth using the `iris` dataset and pediatric overlays.

Why it matters: I had just become a father of twin girls. This was more than a graph—it was grounding.

---

### Challenge 7: Predicting MPG from Horsepower  
File: `challenge7_predict_mpg.R`  

Simple linear regression using `mtcars`. Predicts miles per gallon from horsepower.

Why it matters: Horsepower represents our drive. MPG represents our endurance. This one taught me about balance.

---

### Challenge 8: k-NN Species Classifier  
File: `challenge8_knn_species.R`  

A k-nearest neighbors model (k = 3) trained on `iris`, split into training/test sets.

Why it matters: A metaphor for how close proximity shapes identity, especially in early development.

---

### Challenge 9: Dimensional Alignment with PCA  
Files:  
`challenge9_dimensional_alignment.R`  
`challenge9_pca_plot.png`  

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on `mtcars` to simplify noisy data into meaningful axes.

Why it matters: Sometimes clarity comes not from adding more—but from reducing what's irrelevant.

---

### Challenge 10: Naive Bayes Symbolic Identifier  
File: `challenge10_naive_bayes_classifier.R`  

Builds a Naive Bayes model to predict symbolic species.

Why it matters: Naive Bayes reflects real-life intuition—choosing what’s most likely with limited knowledge.

---

## How to Run

1. Open RStudio
2. Set the working directory to this project folder (`r-challenges`)
3. Open any challenge `.R` script
4. Click Source or run line by line
5. Results appear in the Console or Plots pane

---

## Environment
