# R Programming Portfolio — Even Richardson

Welcome to my R programming portfolio. This repository documents my journey through data science, symbolic algorithm design, and applied machine learning—all rooted in meaning, growth, and real-world intent.

Each folder in this repo represents a focused module:
- [**challenges/**](https://github.com/evenmillz/r-challenges/tree/main/challenges) — Data science and machine learning challenges with symbolic meaning ([View README »](https://github.com/evenmillz/r-challenges/blob/main/challenges/README.md))
- [**algo_data_struct/**](https://github.com/evenmillz/r-challenges/tree/main/algo_data_struct) — Symbolic algorithm and data structure implementations in R ([View README »](https://github.com/evenmillz/r-challenges/blob/main/algo_data_struct/README.md))
- **pluralsight_R/** — Projects from the Pluralsight R Data Science course (in progress)

## Repository Structure

### [`challenges/`](https://github.com/evenmillz/r-challenges/tree/main/challenges)  
Five symbolic challenges covering visualization, modeling, and machine learning using base R and tidyverse tools. Each project is infused with personal meaning and represents real growth in clarity, data literacy, and identity.

### [`algo_data_struct/`](https://github.com/evenmillz/r-challenges/tree/main/algo_data_struct)  
Algorithmic thinking expressed symbolically. This folder contains clean R implementations of sorting, searching, and tree structures, each one reflecting core truths from my life journey.

### `pluralsight_R/` *(in progress)*  
Guided course content following the full data science pipeline in R—from importing and cleaning data to training and deploying predictive models using Shiny.

## Tools Used

- R 4.5.0
- RStudio Desktop (Windows)
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `stats`, `class`, `e1071`, `dplyr`, and base R
- GitHub for version control and portfolio visibility

## Purpose

This repo isn’t just about technical tasks—it’s about transformation. I built it while raising newborn twins, learning symbolic coding as a mental discipline, and pushing myself toward professional excellence in AI and data science.
