# R Challenge Series — Even Richardson

This repository contains 5 required challenge submissions from my R programming track. Each challenge is symbolic, personal, and connects code with deeper meaning, especially during my journey into fatherhood and growth.

## Challenges

### Challenge 6: Twin Growth Explorer  
   `challenge6_twin_growth.R`  
   `challenge6_growth_plot.png`, `challenge6_vs_realworld_plot.png`  

Symbolic visualization of twin development using the `iris` dataset. Column names were redefined to represent head measurements, and a pediatric growth reference was overlayed for contrast.

**Why symbolic?** I had just become a father of twin girls. This challenge helped ground my learning in something real.

---

### Challenge 7: Predicting MPG from Horsepower  
   `challenge7_predict_mpg.R`  

Linear regression using `mtcars` to predict `mpg` from `hp`. This project symbolizes the balance between inner strength (horsepower) and sustainable effort (miles per gallon).

**Why symbolic?** A reflection on how much effort it takes to move through life, and what that effort produces.

---

### Challenge 8: k-NN Species Prediction  
   `challenge8_knn_species.R`  

A k-nearest neighbors (k = 3) classifier trained on the `iris` dataset. Data was split 70/30 to simulate learning on limited experience.

**Why symbolic?** Each "species" is a stand-in for symbolic twin identities (i.e, subtle differences that still carry power).

---

### Challenge 9: Dimensional Alignment via PCA  
   `challenge9_dimensional_alignment.R`  
   `challenge9_pca_plot.png`  

PCA on the `mtcars` dataset to extract clarity from complexity. This challenge visualizes vehicles (and their dimensions) through their most meaningful axes.

**Why symbolic?** Just like in life, sometimes we need to reduce the noise and focus on what truly defines our direction.

---

### Challenge 10: Naive Bayes Symbolic Identifier  
   `challenge10_naive_bayes_classifier.R`  

Trains a Naive Bayes classifier to classify species and predict a new, symbolic flower. A final challenge centered on trusting probability over logic.

**Why symbolic?** Naive Bayes models mirror the wisdom of intuition by acting on what’s most likely without overthinking.

## How to Run Any Challenge

1. Open RStudio  
2. Make sure you’re in the `r-challenges` project folder  
3. Open any `.R` file (e.g., `challenge9_dimensional_alignment.R`)  
4. Click **Source**  
5. View results in the **Console** or **Plots** tab
