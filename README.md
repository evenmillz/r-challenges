Twin Growth Explorer (R Challenge 6)

This repo contains my solution to Challenge 6 from my R training. The challenge involved working with the built-in iris dataset in R. Instead of just using it as-is, I gave it a personal twist, remixing it to reflect what is going on in my real life.

What This Project Does
- Loads the iris dataset
- Renames a couple columns to represent symbolic twin growth measurements
- Treats the Species column as a symbolic stand-in for twin identity
- Prints summary stats grouped by each "twin"
- Displays a scatter plot of head circumference vs. head width
- Includes a PNG version of the plot (`twin_growth_plot.png`) saved from the script

This is all beginner-level R code, and I am using this project to learn the basics.

Why I Made It Symbolic
I just had twin daughters, and this challenge was assigned right around that time. Instead of just doing it the default way, I wanted to make it feel more personal. So I renamed some of the variables to represent things like head circumference and head width. It's not real data about them, but it helped me stay engaged and tie the learning to something that matters to me. 

How to Run the Code
If you want to run this code yourself, here's what to do:
1. Open RStudio
2. Make sure you're inside the r-challenges project
3. Open the file twin_growth_explorer.R
4. Click the Source button at the top right of the script
5. Check the Console for printed summaries
6. Go to the Plots tab to view the scatter plot


Notes
This is Challenge 6 out of 10 in my current R module. I'm not sure if I'll be adding the others to this repo yet. If I do, I will update this README to reflect that.
