# R Challenge Series — Even Richardson

This repository contains five symbolic R programming challenges completed as part of my data science training. Each challenge blends programming skill with personal meaning, completed during my journey into fatherhood and deeper self-discipline.

## Challenges Folder

All challenge scripts and their visual outputs are now located in the `challenges/` folder:

- `challenge6_twin_growth.R`
- `challenge7_predict_mpg.R`
- `challenge8_knn_species.R`
- `challenge9_dimensional_alignment.R`
- `challenge10_naive_bayes_classifier.R`
- Corresponding `.png` visualization files are included

Each challenge is built to highlight a core data science concept, while expressing a deeper symbolic connection to growth, identity, and clarity.
