# R Programming Portfolio — Even Richardson

Welcome to my R programming portfolio. This repository documents my journey through data science, symbolic algorithm design, and applied machine learning—all rooted in meaning, growth, and real-world intent.

Each folder in this repo represents a focused module:
- **challenges/** — Data science and machine learning challenges with symbolic meaning
- **algo_data_struct/** — Hand-built algorithms and data structures in R (in progress)
- **pluralsight_R/** — Projects from the Pluralsight R Data Science course

## Repository Structure

### `challenges/`  
Five symbolic challenges covering visualization, modeling, and ML using base R and tidyverse tools. Each one is infused with personal symbolism and designed to reflect growth, clarity, and identity.

### `algo_data_struct/` *(coming soon)*  
Core algorithm implementations in R, including sorting, searching, tree structures, and symbolic data handling.

### `pluralsight_R/` *(in progress)*  
Guided course content following the full data science pipeline in R—from importing and cleaning data, to training and deploying predictive models using Shiny.

## Tools Used

- R 4.5.0
- RStudio Desktop (Windows)
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `stats`, `class`, `e1071`, `dplyr`, and base R
- GitHub for version control and portfolio visibility

## Purpose

This repo isn’t just about technical tasks—it’s about transformation. I built it while raising newborn twins, learning symbolic coding as a mental discipline, and pushing myself toward professional excellence in AI and data science.
