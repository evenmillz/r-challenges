# Twin Growth Explorer (R Challenge 6)

This repo contains my solution to Challenge 6 from my R training. The challenge involved working with the built-in iris dataset in R. Instead of just using it as-is, I gave it a personal twist, remixing it to reflect what's going on in my real life.

## What This Project Does
- Loads the iris dataset
- Renames a couple columns to represent symbolic twin growth measurements
- Treats the Species column as a symbolic stand-in for twin identity
- Prints summary stats grouped by each "twin"
- Displays a scatter plot of head circumference vs. head width
- Includes a PNG version of the plot (`twin_growth_plot.png`) saved from the script

This is all beginner-level R code, and I'm using this project to learn the basics.

## Why I Made It Symbolic
I just had twin daughters, and this challenge was assigned right around that time. Instead of just doing it the default way, I wanted to make it feel more personal. So I renamed some of the variables to represent things like head circumference and head width. It's not real data about them, but it helped me stay engaged and tie the learning to something that matters to me. 

## How to Run the Code
If you want to try it yourself:
1. Open RStudio
2. Make sure you're inside the `r-challenges` project folder
3. Open the file `twin_growth_explorer.R`
4. Click the **Source** button at the top right of the script
5. Check the **Console** for printed summaries
6. View the plot in the **Plots** tab

No extra libraries needed — it runs on base R.

## Notes
This is Challenge 6 out of 10 in my current R module. I'm not sure if I'll be adding the others to this repo yet. If I do, I'll update this README to reflect that.

## Update: Real-World Comparison

As a father of twin daughters, I added head circumference percentile data from a pediatric growth chart to explore symbolic comparisons between fictional twin patterns and real-world growth benchmarks.

This allows you to visually contrast symbolic twin measurements against clinical norms across weeks 0–13.

## Changelog
- **2025-04-23**: Initial README created and symbolic dataset explained.
- **2025-04-23**: Updated README to include real-world head circumference reference data.
