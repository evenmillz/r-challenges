# R Challenge Series — Even Richardson

This repository contains my submissions for 10 symbolic R programming challenges. Each script reflects real-world thinking, inner growth, and my journey into fatherhood — tying code to meaning in personal ways.

---

## Challenges

### Challenge 6: Twin Growth Explorer  
   `challenge6_twin_growth.R`  
   `challenge6_growth_plot.png`, `challenge6_vs_realworld_plot.png`  

Symbolically maps `iris` data to newborn twin head measurements, with a pediatric reference overlay.

**Why symbolic?** I had just become a father of twins. This challenge helped me emotionally connect learning to real life.

---

### Challenge 7: Predicting MPG from Horsepower  
   `challenge7_predict_mpg.R`  

Predicts `mpg` from `hp` using linear regression on `mtcars`. Horsepower = inner force, MPG = endurance.

**Why symbolic?** Effort versus outcome — a metaphor for how far your inner drive can take you.

---

### Challenge 8: k-NN Species Prediction  
   `challenge8_knn_species.R`  

Trains a k-nearest neighbors model (k = 3) to predict iris species. Uses 70/30 data split.

**Why symbolic?** Each species represents a symbolic “twin type” — a study in similarity and subtle difference.

---

### Challenge 9: Dimensional Alignment via PCA  
   `challenge9_dimensional_alignment.R`  
   `challenge9_pca_plot.png`  

Performs PCA on `mtcars`, reduces dimensions, and visualizes vehicle relationships.

**Why symbolic?** Like life, PCA filters noise to reveal structure. A metaphor for clarity and purpose.

---

### Challenge 10: Naive Bayes Symbolic Identifier  
   `challenge10_naive_bayes_classifier.R`  

Uses a Naive Bayes classifier to identify iris species and predict a symbolic flower.

**Why symbolic?** Naive Bayes represents quiet confidence — learning from patterns without needing complexity.
