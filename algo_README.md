# Algorithms & Data Structures in R — Symbolic Series

This folder contains symbolic implementations of core algorithms and data structures in R.  
Each challenge is a reflection of my growth, reasoning, and commitment to structure—in code and in life.

These are not just academic exercises; they are personal metaphors for sorting through the past, building clarity, and making wise decisions as a developer, father, and strategist.

## Completed Challenges

### 1. `bubble_sort_formula.R`
**Sorting Baby Formula by Price**  
A real-world metaphor for how I weigh decisions as a father of twins—sorting options, protecting resources, and providing wisely.

### 2. `bst.R`
**Binary Search Tree**  
A symbolic representation of life decisions, structured in a hierarchy of priorities. Each node is a moment of growth or clarity in my personal development.

### 3. `store_tree_array.R`
**Store a Tree in an Array**  
A structured encoding of symbolic values like "Faith" and "Discipline" stored in a compact form, representing how we carry deep truths in seemingly simple containers.

## Purpose

To explore algorithms not just for function—but for reflection. Each script mirrors both a concept in computer science and a principle in life.

> "Structure brings clarity. Clarity breeds direction. Algorithms reflect how we think."
