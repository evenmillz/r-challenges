# Decision Tree Classifier - Iris Dataset

This beginner-friendly machine learning project uses the built-in `iris` dataset in R to train and evaluate a simple decision tree classifier using the `tree` package.

## What This Script Does

- Loads the `iris` dataset
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Trains a decision tree model to classify flower species
- Makes predictions on the test data
- Evaluates the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score

## Getting Started

1. Make sure the `tree` package is installed:
   ```r
   install.packages("tree")
