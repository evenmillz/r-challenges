# R Challenges — Symbolic Data Science Series

This folder contains five core R programming challenges, each crafted to explore key data science concepts while reflecting symbolic meaning from my personal journey—particularly during my transition into fatherhood.

Each script demonstrates practical applications of R's statistical and machine learning capabilities using real-world datasets such as `iris` and `mtcars`.

## Challenge Breakdown

### Challenge 6: Twin Growth Explorer
- Files: `challenge6_twin_growth.R`, `challenge6_growth_plot.png`, `challenge6_vs_realworld_plot.png`
- Description: Repurposes the `iris` dataset to simulate head growth tracking for twin girls. Pediatric growth overlays provide visual comparison.

### Challenge 7: Predicting MPG from Horsepower
- File: `challenge7_predict_mpg.R`
- Description: Linear regression using `mtcars` to predict MPG from HP. Symbolizes effort vs outcome—what it takes to keep moving forward.

### Challenge 8: k-NN Species Classifier
- File: `challenge8_knn_species.R`
- Description: Uses a 3-nearest neighbor model to classify species in `iris`. Represents identity formation through proximity and limited experience.

### Challenge 9: Dimensional Alignment with PCA
- Files: `challenge9_dimensional_alignment.R`, `challenge9_pca_plot.png`
- Description: Principal Component Analysis on `mtcars` to extract meaningful dimensions and reduce noise. A metaphor for clarity through reduction.

### Challenge 10: Naive Bayes Symbolic Identifier
- File: `challenge10_naive_bayes_classifier.R`
- Description: Naive Bayes classifier that predicts symbolic flower types based on `iris`. Intuition-led logic as a reflection of trust over complexity.
